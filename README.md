# gabenizer bot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/revan/gabenizer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/revan/gabenizer)

This is a reddit bot which crawls a specified subreddit for its top photos, runs them through
[facial detection](http://skybiometry.com/), and attempts to replace every face with
[Gabe Newell's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Newell).

His face is scaled and rotated to match the size of the target.
If the source image is in grayscale, the output is filtered as well.

##TODO

	-If skintones don't match, apply color filter
    -Direct upload to imgur instead of by URL

Notes for running: this project is designed to run on [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/).
`ssh` into the deployed instance to set the environment variables for API keys and reddit account.

If using a new reddit account, the spam filters will lock out your bot.
Manually post and upvote some material until it stops prompting for CAPTCHAs on every post.
